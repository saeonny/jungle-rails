<h1> About Us <h1>
<br>
<p> Houseplants have infiltrated every room in my house. The foliage hoarding started long before the pandemic, but I, like the legions of housebound plant parents everywhere, doubled down. Of the pandemic-borne hobbies, raising plants has it all: physical health benefits,
 mental health benefits, and a very low barrier to entry. 
 In a time that felt stagnant, nurturing growth was the antidote.
